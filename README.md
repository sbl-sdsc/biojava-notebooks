# BioJava in Jupyter Notebooks 
[![GitHub License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/sbl-sdsc/biojava-notebooks.svg)](https://github.com/sbl-sdsc/biojava-notebooks/blob/master/LICENSE)

This repository demonstrates how to run [BioJava](https://biojava.org/) applications in a Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab.

This project uses the Java Kernel developed by the [BeakerX project](http://beakerx.com), a collection of kernels that provide JVM support for Jupyter Notebook and Lab.

The nbviewer links below provide a non-interactive preview of notebooks and the launch links launch the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab in your web browser using the Binder ([mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/)) server (may be slow!).
